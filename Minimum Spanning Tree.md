# Minimum Spanning Tree on undirected graph
- This is combinatorial optimization problem
- This has optimal substructure
https://leetcode.com/problems/connecting-cities-with-minimum-cost/

# Kruskal's algorithm
- Use greedy approach
- Sorted edges by weight
- Apply Union and Find algorithm


# Prim's algorithm
- Invented by Dijkastra and named as Prim's algo as it was already discoved by Prim
- This is based on captured/discovered/undiscovered approach
- Start from some vertex
- treat this vertex as source
- At each step, there is single structure, which expands slowly
- Structure remains connected
